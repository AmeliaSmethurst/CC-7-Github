# CC-7-Github

### This repository contains a sample script to serve as an example when syncing RStudio with Github.

The full tutorial is available to view here: https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html

`GIT_TEST.Rproj`, `Sample_script.R`, and `temp_elevation.csv` are resources used during the tutorial.

`git_cli.png` provides a flow chart for some simple git commands to be used in the command line. `{hub}` indicates that the command requires installation of [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub), a wrapper for `Git` that increases functionality
